# Gmail API Newsletter Generator

Gmail API Newsletter Generator - a Python application designed to automate the creation and distribution of email newsletters. This tool gatheres content via specified APIsâ€”such as historical births on this day (Wikimedia API), random dad jokes (Icanhazdadjoke API) and constructs an engaging newsletter format that is then sent to a user-specified email address.

## Features

- **Dynamic API Integration**: The application integrates with two public APIs. It fetches historical events of the day from Wikimedia and a random joke from the icanhazdadjoke.com API.
- **Email Integration**: Using the Gmail API, the application sends fetched and compiled HTML content as a newsletter to a specified email address.
- **Customizable Content**: Users can select which API's content (Wikimedia historical events or jokes) they wish to receive in their newsletter via command-line arguments.
- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes environment variables for secure authentication handling (for API tokens and Gmail access).

## Getting started

1. To install the required dependencies, navigate to the project folder and run:

    `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

2. To set up environment variables create a `.env` file in the root directory and update it with your credentials and tokens:

    ```plaintext
    WIKIMEDIA_ACCESS_TOKEN=YourWikimediaToken
    USER_EMAIL=YourEmailForUserAgent
    APP_PASSWORD=YourAppPasswordForGmail
    ```

3. Run the project:

    Ensure you provide a valid email and choose between the two API options (`wikimedia` or `jokes`). Execute the command:

    ```python3 daily-newsletter.py your-email@example.com api_choice```

4. If evething is okay, you will receive an email with the newsletter content.

## To run unit tests
